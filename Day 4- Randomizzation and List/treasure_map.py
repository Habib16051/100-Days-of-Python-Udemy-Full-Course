# Instructions
# You are going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.
#
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
#
# # This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:


# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️", "⬜️", "⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️", "⬜️", "⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️", "⬜️", "⬜️"]

map = [row1, row2, row3]

print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# Write your code below this row 👇

horizontal = int(position[0])
vertical = int(position[1])

selected_row = map[vertical - 1]
selected_row[horizontal - 1] = "X"

# Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
