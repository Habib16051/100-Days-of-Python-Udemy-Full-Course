# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log.
# You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.
#
# Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add
# the entry for Russia to the travel_log.
#
# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
# You've visited Russia 2 times.
#
# You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
#
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly.
# You need to create a function that modifies it.
