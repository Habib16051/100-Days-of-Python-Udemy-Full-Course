# Instructions
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
#
# https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
#
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until
# 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
#
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
#
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?\n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡


age_as_int = int(age)

years_remaining = 90 - age_as_int

months_remaining = years_remaining * 12
weeks_remaining = years_remaining * 52
days_remaining = years_remaining * 365

print(f"You have {days_remaining} days, {weeks_remaining} weeks,{months_remaining} months left.")
