# Instructions
# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
#
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
#
# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.

#
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# Warning you should round the result to the nearest whole number.
# The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above.
# e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

BMI = int(float(weight / float(height * height)))

# x = float(weight)
# y = float(height)

# BMI = int(x/(y*y))

if BMI < 18.5:
    print(f'Your BMI is {BMI}, you are underweight.')
elif BMI > 18.5 and BMI < 25:
    print(f'Your BMI is {BMI}, you have a normal weight.')
elif BMI > 25 and BMI < 30:
    print(f'Your BMI is {BMI}, you are slightly   overweight')

elif BMI > 30 and BMI < 35:
    print(f'Your BMI is {BMI}, you are obese.')
elif BMI > 35:
    print(f'Your BMI is {BMI}, you are clinically obese.')
