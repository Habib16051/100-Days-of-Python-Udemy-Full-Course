# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
#
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
#
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentors."
#
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
#
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
#
# "Your score is **z**."
#
# e.g.
#
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
#
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
#
# T occurs 0 times
#
# R occurs 1 time
#
# U occurs 2 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 5
#
# L occurs 1 time
#
# O occurs 0 times
#
# V occurs 0 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 3
#
# Love Score = 53
#
# Print: "Your score is 53."

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
combine_string = name1 + name2
lower_string = combine_string.lower()

t = lower_string.count('t')
r = lower_string.count('r')
u = lower_string.count('u')
e = lower_string.count('e')

true = t + r + u + e

l = lower_string.count('l')
o = lower_string.count('o')
v = lower_string.count('v')
e = lower_string.count('e')

love = l + o + v + e

love_score = int(str(true) + str(love))

if (love_score < 10) or (love_score > 90):
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")

elif 40 <= love_score <= 50:
    print(f"your score is {love_score}, you are alright together.")

else:
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}.")
